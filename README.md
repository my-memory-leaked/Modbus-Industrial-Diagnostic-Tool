# Application for Diagnosing Industrial Devices with Modbus Interface

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of specialized software for industrial devices, with a focus on integration with AUMA systems. The application aims to efficiently manage and monitor advanced systems using the Modbus TCP protocol, ensuring high compatibility and communication efficiency.

## Features

- **Connection Configuration**: Allows input of device IP address and port.
- **Status Monitoring**: Regularly checks device warnings and errors.
- **Diagnostics**: Advanced diagnostic tests for devices.
- **Reporting**: Clear presentation of diagnostic results.

## Main Menu

- **Device List**: Displays available devices and their network parameters, including connection type (TCP), IP address, and port.
- **Change Settings**: Allows users to configure the connection settings such as IP address and port, essential for communication with the diagnostic device.
- **Select Test**: Provides a variety of diagnostic tests that can be performed on the selected device. Users can choose the desired test and view detailed descriptions before execution.
- **Diagnostic Results**: Shows the results of the diagnostic tests. The results are displayed clearly, indicating whether the test was successful or if any issues were detected.
